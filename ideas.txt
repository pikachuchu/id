        Moving opponent pieces costs 2x as much as moving your own
        Place enemy cells (kill cost?)

    Volcano:
        1st stage: smoke on cell, weakens land
        2nd stage: smoke on 3x3, lava on cell
        3rd stage: lava on 3x3
        Flashing red or gray for smoke warning
        Red in external for lava

        Colors denote level in gui
        Level comes from land value
            0 - 5 <BLACK> Dead land can support no cells
            5 - 25 <RED> Diminished land can suport a cell that has 2 neighbors
            25 - 75 <LIGHT-GREEN> Starting land can support a cell that has 2 to 3 neighbors
            75 - 100 <DARK-GREEN> Enriched land can support a cell that has 2 to 4 neighbors
        Living land regenerates
        Cells consume land value
        Specialized cells consume more land value

    Transferring specializations to offspring:
        Each cell has three strands of DNA
        A strand contains a list of genes
        Each cell is either on or off for a specific phenotype
        Parents will pass one of their strands of DNA to offspring (equally likely)
        Therefore each offspring has 3 strands again
        Two genes may be opposites of each other, in which case the third strand determines the phenotype, for example:
            S and P are opposites
            Offspring gets SgP
            Phenotype would be g
    Special friendly cells:
        Missionary: converts adjacent enemy cell to friendly with some probability
        Fertility: can reproduce with fewer than 3 cells
        Warrior: starts out with more strength
        Scientist: randomly garners technology points while alive and can help spawn more scientists
    Point systems:
        Technology: allows for relocation of cells, greater food supply to support more population, in vitro fertilization (add cell anywhere)
        Evolution: garner points by killing enemies and reproducing, can be used for evolving cells, lose points for killing own cells
        Can spend points to move your pieces AND ENEMY PIECES
    Random events:
        Lightning strike: kills cell
        Tornado: kills cell, rotates adjacent cells ccw
    Special enemies:
        Predator: harder to kill
        Virus: can infect a cell and lower strength
        Vampire: can infect a cell and convert
        Suicide bomber: can kill self and all adjacent cells
    Infection mechanism:
        Chance to infect one adjacent enemy cell
        Evolution points can be spent for resistance





Micro game:
    control each step
    accumulate points to spend on:
        adding organism
        moving organism
    random events:
        natural disaster (affects large area)
        lightning strike (affects 1 organism)
    goal:
        eliminate all of opposing species
    difficulty adjustment:
        win under certain number of steps
        amount of points awarded
Macro game:
    give update every x number of steps
    evolve characteristics to help species:
        strength increase
        technology (food production)
        
General ideas:
    resources determine overpopulation
