Land and fertility
    Colors denote level in gui
    Level comes from land value
        0 - 5 <BLACK> Dead land can support no cells
        5 - 25 <RED> Diminished land can suport a cell that has 2 neighbors
        25 - 75 <LIGHT-GREEN> Starting land can support a cell that has 2 to 3 neighbors
        75 - 100 <DARK-GREEN> Enriched land can support a cell that has 2 to 4 neighbors
    Living land regenerates
    Cells consume land value
    Specialized cells consume more land value

Transferring specializations to offspring:
    Each cell has three strands of DNA
    A strand contains a list of genes
    Each cell is either on or off for a specific phenotype
    Parents will pass one of their strands of DNA to offspring (equally likely)
    Therefore each offspring has 3 strands again
    Two genes may be opposites of each other, in which case the third strand determines the phenotype, for example:
        S and P are opposites
        Offspring gets SgP
        Phenotype would be g
Special friendly cells:
    Missionary: converts adjacent enemy cell to friendly with some probability
    Fertility: can reproduce with fewer than 3 cells
    Warrior: starts out with more strength
    Scientist: randomly garners technology points while alive and can help spawn more scientists
Point systems:
    Technology: allows for relocation of cells, greater food supply to support more population, in vitro fertilization (add cell anywhere)
    Evolution: garner points by killing enemies and reproducing, can be used for evolving cells, lose points for killing own cells
    Can spend points to move your pieces AND ENEMY PIECES
Random events:
    Lightning strike: kills cell
    Tornado: kills cell, rotates adjacent cells ccw
Special enemies:
    Predator: harder to kill
    Virus: can infect a cell and lower strength
    Vampire: can infect a cell and convert
    Suicide bomber: can kill self and all adjacent cells
Infection mechanism:
    Chance to infect one adjacent enemy cell
    Evolution points can be spent for resistance





Micro game:
    control each step
    accumulate points to spend on:
        adding organism
        moving organism
    random events:
        natural disaster (affects large area)
        lightning strike (affects 1 organism)
    goal:
        eliminate all of opposing species
    difficulty adjustment:
        win under certain number of steps
        amount of points awarded
Macro game:
    give update every x number of steps
    evolve characteristics to help species:
        strength increase
        technology (food production)
        
General ideas:
    resources determine overpopulation
