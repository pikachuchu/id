Specialization tree
Transferring specializations to offspring:
    Each cell has three strands of DNA
    A strand contains a list of genes
    Each cell is either on or off for a specific phenotype
    Parents will pass one of their strands of DNA to offspring (equally likely)
    Therefore each offspring has 3 strands again
    Two genes may be opposites of each other, in which case the third strand determines the phenotype, for example:
        S and P are opposites
        Offspring gets SgP
        Phenotype would be g
Special friendly cells:
    Missionary: converts adjacent enemy cell to friendly with some probability
    Fertility: can reproduce with fewer than 3 cells
    Warrior: starts out with more strength
    Scientist: randomly garners technology points while alive and can help spawn more scientists
Point systems:
    Technology: allows for relocation of cells, greater food supply to support more population, in vitro fertilization (add cell anywhere)
    Evolution: garner points by killing enemies and reproducing, can be used for evolving cells, lose points for killing own cells
Random events:
    Lightning strike: kills cell
    Tornado: kills cell, rotates adjacent cells ccw
Special enemies:
    Predator: harder to kill
    Virus: can infect a cell and lower strength
    Vampire: can infect a cell and convert
    Suicide bomber: can kill self and all adjacent cells
Infection mechanism:
    Chance to infect one adjacent enemy cell
    Evolution points can be spent for resistance





Micro game:
    control each step
    accumulate points to spend on:
        adding organism
        moving organism
    random events:
        natural disaster (affects large area)
        lightning strike (affects 1 organism)
    goal:
        eliminate all of opposing species
    difficulty adjustment:
        win under certain number of steps
        amount of points awarded
Macro game:
    give update every x number of steps
    evolve characteristics to help species:
        strength increase
        technology (food production)
        
General ideas:
    resources determine overpopulation
